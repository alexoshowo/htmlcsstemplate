# PLAIN HTML CSS TEMPLATE
A simple template I made for simplifying a process of creating websites.

## It contains:
* index.html with usual boilerplate code and some pre-made parameters and elements, also comes with all css and js dependecies linked
* main.css file with the most common tags and properties I use
* fonts.css and /fonts/ folder for hosting and setting up fonts locally
* src folder with app.js file in it
